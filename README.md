__Coordinates Demo__<br>
Javascript provides us with multiple functions to track the mouse as it relates to the DOM:
```javascript
pageX, pageY
offsetX, offsetY
screenX, screenY
clientX, clientY
```
As you can expect, these all give us different values for mouse coordinates as they use different reference points.
This section of the app provides you with a visual representation of how these values relate to the mouse position and to one another.
